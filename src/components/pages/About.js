            <p class="left-align">Hi, my name is Cassiano Danielsson, I'm 18 years old and one of my goals is to be a developer and build a whole career around it. It is an area with a lot of logic, which many may find strange due to my inclination towards more artistic areas due to the skills I have developed during my life.</p>
            <p class="left-align">I didn't have much contact with programming before I was 15 and I started a systems development course integrated into my high school. After seeing a promising direction for this area, along with the pleasure I had in creating codes, I continued studying and practicing.</p>
            <p class="left-align">In this technical course integrated into high school, we learn the basics of programming languages ​​such as C, Java, HTML/CSS/Javascript, NodeJS, MYSQL, within subjects such as programming logic, WEB development, database, system testing and fundamentals of design.</p>
            <p class="left-align">Nowadays, I ended up having more affinity with the Back-end side. I have some projects already done in NodeJS and Laravel (and this one made in ReactJS) and I'm always studying and building my portfolio.</p>
